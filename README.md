# Final-Project-Computational-Intelligence

For our final project, we choose Volcanic Eruptions in the Holocene Period dataset, that can be found on Kaggle trough this link https://www.kaggle.com/smithsonian/volcanic-eruptions, with this dataset, we have successfully do a clustering of the volcanic eruption using their longitude and latitude with K-Means method, we also try to use Within-Cluster-Sum-of-Squares for the K-Means method, although the results are the same with the first K-Means method that didnâ€™t use the Within-Cluster-Sum-of-Squares. We also try to use Support Vector Machine or SVM, Decision Tree with Gini Index and Entropy, and K-Nearest Neighbors with Manhattan Distance and Euclidean Distance to classify the type of the volcanic eruption using their longitude, latitude, country, and region.
